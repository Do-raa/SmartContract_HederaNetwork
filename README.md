The goal of this project is to master the Smart Contract Service of the Hedera network by completing the following exercise. 

Exercise 3: Smart contract service

 - You'll need to create an account in addition to your testnet account.

 - Using the :

 - HelloHedera.sol (This smart contract allows you to store and change the address of an account) 

 - HelloHedera.json (compiled contract)

 - And using the smart contract service:

 - Deploy the smart contract on Hedera (using ContractCreateFlow() and bytecode)

 - Call the get_address function and display the address of your testnet account.

 - Call the set_address function, specifying the address of the new account.

 - Call the get_address function again to check that the address has been modified
